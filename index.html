            <h3>Here are some interesting facts about Hayao Miyazaki's life</h3>
            <h4> Miyazaki was a huge fan of aviation</h4>
            <p>
              The theme of flying, sometimes on the most fantastic aircrafts, has been
              crucial in Miyazaki’s every work — starting with "Laputa: The Castle in
              the Sky," finding its place in "Porco Rosso" and "Howl's Moving Castle",
              and culminating in the director’s latest work "The Wind Rises."
            </p>
            <h4> He did not work within his specialty for a single day</h4>
            <p>
              Miyazaki has repeatedly admitted that he had dreamt of becoming an
              animator from childhood. He realized that in high school when he saw the
              animated film "The Legend of the White Snake" in the cinema.
            </p>
            <h4> He wasn’t going to become a director</h4>
            <p>
              A post-apocalyptic story about a heroic princess defending a peaceful
              valley from war for exhausted natural resources was published in Animage
              Magazine. The original agreement with publishers forbade Miyazaki to
              make a film version of "Nausicaä," but the popularity of the manga
              forced them to ask the animator to make a series of the same name.
              Miyazaki would agree only to a full-length film.The producer of Studio
              Ghibli, Toshio Suzuki, persuaded him to take up the next film — "Laputa:
              The Castle in the Sky." But despite the "prestigious" status of a
              director, Hayao Miyazaki has always been primarily an animation artist.
            </p>
            <h4> Nature plays a distinctive role in his films</h4>
            <p>
              Miyazaki himself admitted that the manner of depicting nature is one of
              the distinguishing features of the animated films created in Studio
              Ghibli.Miyazaki has always loved travelling. In his numerous trips
              around the world, he sought, above all, the scenery for his films. From
              Wales, for example, he brought ideas for "Laputa: The Castle in the Sky"
              and "Howl's Moving Castle" (based on a novel by British author Diana
              Wynne Jones). It’s interesting that Miyazaki "spied" on many landscapes
              from "Howl's Moving Castle" while traveling in Kazakhstan and Alsace.
            </p>
            <h4> He taught children to dream again</h4>
            <p>
              Speaking of his work, Hayao Miyazaki has repeatedly admitted that his
              own studio has finally allowed him to start making films that he thought
              were so necessary for his viewers. He wanted to teach children to
              imagine, dream of traveling and believe in miracles. The unconditional
              success of his fabulous parables proves that he succeeded in it.

              You must see with eyes unclouded by hate. See the good in that which is evil, and the evil in that which is good. Pledge yourself to neither side, but vow instead to preserve the balance that exists between the two.
